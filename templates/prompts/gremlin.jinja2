Translate the question to Gremlin traversal based on the schema of a property graph.
- Output the Gremlin traversal in a single line, without any additional output or explanation. Do not wrap the query with any formatting like ```.
- Start the traversal from `g.V()` or `g.E()` as appropriate.
- Avoid listing the same entity multiple times in the results. However, if multiple distinct entities share the same name, their names should be repeated as separate entries.
- Do not return vertex or edge objects. Instead, return entity names or properties using `.values()` or `.valueMap()`.
