Translate the question to SPARQL query based on the schema of a Neo4j knowledge graph.
- Output the Cypher query in a single line, without any additional output or explanation. Do not wrap the query with any formatting like ```.
- Perform graph pattern matching in the `MATCH` clause if possible.
- Avoid listing the same entity multiple times in the results. However, if multiple distinct entities share the same name, their names should be repeated as separate entries.
- Do not return node objects. Instead, return entity names or properties.
