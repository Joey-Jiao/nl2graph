Translate the question to SPARQL query based on the schema of an RDF knowledge graph.
- Output the SPARQL query in a single line, without any additional output or explanation. Do not wrap the query with any formatting like ```.
- Use triple patterns in the `WHERE` clause and return results with `SELECT`.
- Avoid listing the same entity multiple times in the results. However, if multiple distinct entities share the same name, their names should be repeated as separate entries.
- Do not return URIs directly. Instead, return human-readable labels or literal values.
